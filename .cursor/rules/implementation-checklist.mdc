# ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST RULE

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### **ALWAYS** check the implementation checklist before starting any work:
**File Location**: `planning/IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md`

### **NEVER** check a box without thorough testing:
1. **IMPLEMENT** â†’ **TEST** â†’ **VERIFY** â†’ **DOCUMENT** â†’ **CHECK BOX**
2. **Multiple test cases** required for each feature
3. **User-level testing** (not just technical testing)
4. **Edge case verification** (error handling, mobile, etc.)
5. **Performance testing** (load times, responsiveness)

## ðŸ”„ MANDATORY WORKFLOW

### **Before Starting Work:**
1. **READ** `planning/IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md` to understand current status
2. **IDENTIFY** which checklist items you'll be working on
3. **MARK** relevant items as in-progress

### **During Development:**
1. **UPDATE** checklist items as you complete them
2. **CHECK OFF** completed items with `[x]`
3. **ADD** any new tasks discovered during implementation

### **After Completing Work:**
1. **TEST** the implementation thoroughly (multiple test cases)
2. **VERIFY** functionality works as expected (user testing)
3. **DOCUMENT** test results and any edge cases discovered
4. **ONLY THEN** check the box with test verification notes
5. **COMMIT** checklist changes to git with test confirmation

## âœ… CHECKLIST UPDATE FORMAT

**NEVER check a box without completing ALL verification steps:**

### **Before Checking Any Box:**
1. **IMPLEMENT** the feature completely
2. **TEST** the functionality thoroughly  
3. **VERIFY** it works as expected
4. **DOCUMENT** any issues or notes
5. **ONLY THEN** check the box `[x]`

**When marking items complete:**
```markdown
- [x] **Task Name**: TESTED and verified working - [brief description of what was completed and how it was tested]
```

**When adding new tasks:**
```markdown
- [ ] **New Task**: Description of what needs to be done
```

**Example of proper completion:**
```markdown
- [x] **Contact Form**: TESTED and verified working - Form submits successfully, reCAPTCHA validates, emails arrive at management@tgmventures.com with proper formatting
```

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT FOCUS AREAS

**Phase 2 (Current)**: Domain migration and final testing
**Phase 3 (Next)**: Team dashboard with Google OAuth authentication

## ðŸ“ž SUPPORT REFERENCE

**Key Project Files:**
- `README.md` - Core project rules
- `planning/IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md` - Master task list

**Remember**: This checklist is the single source of truth for project status and next steps. Always keep it updated!
