# üîí PROTECTED FILES - DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT PERMISSION

## Core Pages (Require Explicit User Approval)
These files maintain the intentionally simple, professional aesthetic:

- `index.html` - Homepage with black background and warehouse image
- `privacy-policy.html` - Legal compliance document  
- `terms-of-service.html` - Legal compliance document
- `style.css` - Core homepage styling

## Legacy Projects (Completely Hands-Off)
These are grandfathered legacy projects that must never be touched:

- `projects/refihub/` - Complete RefiHub project directory
- `projects/legacy-games/` - Legacy HTML game files

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULE
Before modifying ANY of these files:
1. Ask user for explicit permission
2. Explain what changes you want to make
3. Wait for approval before proceeding

**Violation of this rule could break the professional website or destroy legacy projects.**
