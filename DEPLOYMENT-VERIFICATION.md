## Troubleshooting

### If SendGrid API key access fails:
```bash
# Grant Cloud Functions access to the secret
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding SENDGRID_API_KEY \
  --member="serviceAccount:tgm-ventures-site@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor" \
  --project=tgm-ventures-site
```

### If function deployment fails:
```bash
# Check detailed error logs
gcloud functions logs read \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --project=tgm-ventures-site \
  --limit=50
```

### If test email doesn't arrive:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Check SendGrid activity: app.sendgrid.com > Settings > Activity
3. Check function logs: `firebase functions:log`
4. Verify your email is in Firestore users collection
5. Check SendGrid delivery status dashboard

### If scheduler doesn't trigger:
```bash
# Manually trigger the job to test
gcloud scheduler jobs run firebase-schedule-weeklyReportEmailEnhanced-us-central1 \
  --location=us-central1 \
  --project=tgm-ventures-site
```
