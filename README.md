A professional management company website for TGM Ventures, Inc., a Washington state corporation specializing in building, buying, and managing businesses and real estate.

## üö® CRITICAL PRESERVATION RULES

### Core Pages - DO NOT MODIFY WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION
The following pages must remain **EXACTLY** as they are and maintain their simple, elegant design:

- **Homepage (`index.html`)** - Simple black background with warehouse image, TGM logo, and tagline
- **Privacy Policy (`privacy-policy.html`)** - Comprehensive legal document 
- **Terms of Service (`terms-of-service.html`)** - Comprehensive legal document

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: These pages are intentionally minimal and professional. Any changes to their design, content, or functionality require explicit user approval before implementation.

### Legacy Projects - GRANDFATHERED & PROTECTED
The following files and directories are legacy projects that must NOT be touched or modified:

```
/refihub/                    # Complete RefiHub project directory
/refihub-deal-analyzer.html  # Legacy RefiHub files in root
/refihub-game.html
/refihub-loan-request.html
/stock-game.html
```

These files are grandfathered into the V2 structure and should be preserved exactly as-is.
