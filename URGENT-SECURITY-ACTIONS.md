# üö® URGENT SECURITY ACTIONS REQUIRED

## ‚úÖ SECURITY INCIDENT RESOLVED!

### **COMPLETED ACTIONS:**

### 1. **‚úÖ REVOKED THE COMPROMISED FIREBASE API KEY**
- **OLD KEY DELETED**: `AIzaSyAffXsVM8HjEVlDc8kX9Wzkv9muD_zFWGA` 
- Used Google Cloud CLI to permanently delete the exposed key
- Key is no longer valid and cannot be used

### 2. **‚úÖ GENERATED NEW SECURE API KEY**
- **NEW KEY CREATED**: `AIzaSyCNdqeqeJL1W2vP0hpRLuEwYNPXomKkxRo`
- Applied same Firebase service restrictions as original
- Key is properly secured in gitignored config.js file

### 3. **‚úÖ UPDATED CONFIGURATION SYSTEM**
- New API key automatically loaded into `/config.js`
- Configuration system is working properly
- All sensitive data is now protected

### 4. **üß™ TEST THE DASHBOARD**
**Next step**: Test the dashboard to verify everything works:
1. Open `/src/dashboard/login.html` in your browser
2. Try to sign in with your @tgmventures.com Google account
3. Verify authentication works with the new API key

## ‚úÖ SECURITY FIXES ALREADY COMPLETED

### **Code Security:**
- ‚úÖ Removed exposed API key from all code files
- ‚úÖ Implemented secure configuration system
- ‚úÖ Added `config.js` to .gitignore
- ‚úÖ Created security documentation and rules
- ‚úÖ Updated cursor rules to prevent future exposure

### **Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `src/dashboard/js/firebase-config.js` - Removed hardcoded key
- ‚úÖ `public/dashboard/js/firebase-config.js` - Removed hardcoded key
- ‚úÖ All HTML files updated to load configuration properly
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` updated to protect sensitive files
- ‚úÖ Security rules and documentation created

## üîê NEW SECURITY SYSTEM

### **How It Works:**
1. **config.js** (gitignored) contains all sensitive keys
2. **config.example.js** provides template for setup
3. HTML files load config.js before firebase-config.js
4. Firebase configuration reads from `window.TGMConfig.firebase`

### **Benefits:**
- No more hardcoded secrets in version control
- Easy to manage different environments
- Clear separation of public and private data
- Follows security best practices
